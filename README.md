## Introduction:

- A simple file encryption and decryption app. A personal project that is a variation of [this project](https://github.com/nadupoy/File-Encryption-and-Decryption).

- Tools and technologies used are:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - Visual Studio Code
  - [Crypto JS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js?utm_source=cdnjs&utm_medium=cdnjs_link&utm_campaign=cdnjs_library)
  - [Bower](https://bower.io/)

## What I Learnt:

### Client Side Encryption:

- I found [this](https://www.internetsafetystatistics.com/javascript-encryption-guide/) article by [Internet Safety Statistics](https://www.internetsafetystatistics.com/) to be a comprehensive introduction to encryption using JavaScript, particularly on the client side.

- Initially, I had planned to write my own encryption and decryption function(s) (i.e. algorithms), but it didn't take long for me to realise that I had bitten off more than I could chew, resulting in unnecessary and avoidable frustration. üòÖ

- There are JavaScript libraries for this purpose such as [CryptoJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/crypto-js). [Kinsta.com](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/) also has an article on some \*popular JavaScript libraries.

- I was also introduced to **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** and **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**, two robust and well-established cryptographic algorithms. <br/>
  I am eager to learn more about them and algorithms in general. üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´

**_N/B:_** [This](https://www.internetsafetystatistics.com/common-encryption-methods/) article is of interest to me. I thought to include it here for future reference. üîç

### 'Bower' Package Manager Error:

- After installing [Bower](https://bower.io/), I encountered the following error in the command terminal when trying to install [Crypto JS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js?utm_source=cdnjs&utm_medium=cdnjs_link&utm_campaign=cdnjs_library):

```
'bower' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

- Installing Bower without using the 'g' flag seems to have resulted in this error.
  <br/>
  Re-installation using the 'g' flag fixed the error.
